The Clean Code experience I have learned：
1. Use meaningful names to make the code more readable.
2. Write short functions, with each function responsible for a single clear task (Single Responsibility Principle).
3. Add comments at appropriate places to help others understand the code logic, but avoid excessive commenting.
