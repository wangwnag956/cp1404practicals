# Practical 06
What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have become more proactive in my weekly planning. Previously, I would always start working on tasks at the last minute. But after reflection, now I will schedule specific working times into my schedule and break down larger projects into smaller and more manageable tasks. This helps me better plan my time and understand the requirements of the tasks.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve my time management skills. Sometimes I underestimate the time required for programming or reading. I also hope to seek help more proactively as soon as I encounter difficulties, rather than constantly thinking on my own and wasting time.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I attended the lectures and tutorial sessions on time, and regularly completed the practical assignments. Sometimes I would review the feedback and use it to guide my own improvement.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I can no longer sacrifice time to speed up the completion of the exercises. Sometimes doing so may lead to the neglect of important concepts. I need to understand the logic behind each task rather than merely completing them.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I hope there can be more industry lectures or internship opportunities so that the course content can be linked to actual IT job positions and requirements
