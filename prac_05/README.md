# Practical 05

I started working on this assignment on June 14th and it took me about 4 hours to complete it over several days. This included:
40 minutes for initial setup and understanding the requirements
2 hours for implementing the core functionality
20 minutes for debugging and testing edge cases
10 minutes for final testing and preparing for submission
The most time-consuming part was implementing proper input validation and ensuring the output format was exactly the same as the example. I also spent a lot of time learning how to use Git for version control correctly.
2. Here is my plan:
A more thorough planning stage
Create detailed pseudocode before writing actual code
Break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts
Set intermediate deadlines for each component
Improved version control practices
Make more frequent small commits (commit every 30 to 60 minutes of work)
Write more descriptive commit messages in imperative mood
Create feature branches for experimental changes
Enhanced testing methods
Develop test cases before implementation (test-driven development approach)
Test edge cases more thoroughly from the beginning
Create a test checklist to ensure all requirements are verified.
Code quality improvements
Allocate specific time for code review and refactoring
Add more comprehensive docstrings and comments
Time management
Start early to avoid last-minute rush.
Use the Pomodoro Technique for focused work sessions
Regularly schedule progress checks
Documentation
Maintain a development log to record decision-making
